# SynthMachine
A set of Modular synthesizer modules designed around the SSI2130 VCO, SSI2140 Multi-Mode Filter, and the Daisy Seed Microcontroller.

Firmware requires a daisy seed build environment to compile, see daisy seed startup guide (https://daisy.audio/tutorials/cpp-dev-env/), requires updated libdaisy, daisysp, etc... to be cloned from relevant repos.
